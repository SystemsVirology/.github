# The Systems Virology Lab

The Systems Virology lab at Laboratory Medicine focuses on using systems biology and experimental approaches to understand the biology of host-pathogen interactions targeted towards the RNA viruses. The group aims to identify the components of the immune response that are required for natural immune protection and disease severity that can be translated into the future development of vaccine and antiviral strategies against emerging and re-emerging viruses.
